Test::CGI::External is a tool for running basic checks of the
operation of a CGI program. It is meant to be used for "sanity checks"
of CGI program operation before a program is uploaded to a web server.

For example, say there is a program called "example.cgi" and it is
required to test that example.cgi produces a correct Content-Type
header, does not print out ill-formed headers (for example, print
debugging messages on standard output), or test whether example.cgi
exits with a zero status, or does not print error messages during
normal operations.  Test::CGI::External tests whether example.cgi is a
valid CGI program in place, that is to say Test::CGI::External is
meant for testing the CGI program before it is put on to a web
server. Because it is meant to do basic sanity tests which would
usually cause things like 500 errors when used on a web server,
Test::CGI::External does not access CGI programs via a web server, but
as a stand-alone program, under a faked CGI-like environment created
by manipulating environment variables.

In a Perl script,

    my $tester = Test::CGI::External->new ();
    $tester->set_cgi_executable ('example.cgi');
    my %options;
    $tester->run (\%options);

The tested CGI program can be in any language; Test::CGI::External is
meant to test external programs which are completely independent of
itself. Test::CGI::External was originally created to check the
operation of CGI programs written in the C programming language.
