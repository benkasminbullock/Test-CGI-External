Test::CGI::External is a tool for running tests on a CGI program. Say
there is a program called "example.cgi" and it is required to test
that example.cgi produces a correct Content-Type header and does not
print out ill-formed headers. Test::CGI::External tests whether
example.cgi is a valid CGI program in place. Test::CGI::External does
not access example.cgi via a web server, but as a stand-alone program.

The tested CGI program can be in any language; Test::CGI::External is
meant to test external programs.
